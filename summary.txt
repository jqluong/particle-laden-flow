Code to solve the fixed-volume bidensity problem to compare with experimental data. A formal readme may exist in the future.

Folders:

scripts: Contains code to generate data and plots for the comparison. Documentation can be found there.

experimental_data: (rename) .mat files of experimental data.

ODEsolve: Solves the equilibrium BVP for given volume fractions. All the parameters for the problem are defined in set_constants2.

ODEdata: includes tables of fluxes for the default parameters (current settings of set_constants2) for some useful angles. Use these unless new ones need to be computed (it can take a few hours).

bidisperse_pde: Includes a script to generate the pre-computed flux table (generate_flux_table). Also has the code that solves the dynamic problem (bidisperse_PDE_exp). 

plotting: some plotting tools used by plot_soln (can be edited out).
